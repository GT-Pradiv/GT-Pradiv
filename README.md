### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Pradiv Gnanaraj, a Technical Support Engineer passionate about process improvement and team leadership.

I currently work with a leading AI-based SaaS company, where I specialize in resolving complex technical issues and improving system stability. My background in systems and infrastructure, particularly with ESXi, gives me a unique perspective on managing technical operations and optimizing cloud-native applications.

I'm focused on a **Technical Support Leadership Track**, actively building a portfolio of knowledge and processes to streamline operations and enhance team performance.

### What I'm Doing Now

* **Improving SaaS Workflows:** I'm gaining real-world experience in API troubleshooting (OAuth2, SAML), scripting (Python, Bash), and resolving common database and cloud-related issues to identify key areas for process automation.
* **Building a Knowledge Base:** I'm documenting my learnings and most common troubleshooting scenarios on my blog and in a self-published book, which you can soon find here: [Link to your website/blog]. This content is designed to empower L1 support and reduce escalation rates.
* **Growing a Business:** I am building a portfolio of digital products on Gumroad to share my knowledge with the community and create a passive income stream. This also allows me to explore team management and scaling from a business perspective.
