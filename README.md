### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Pradiv Gnanaraj, an L2 Support Engineer with a passion for SaaS troubleshooting and a drive for automation.

I currently work with a leading AI-based SaaS company, where I specialize in resolving complex technical issues and improving system stability. My background in systems and infrastructure, particularly with ESXi, gives me a unique perspective on managing and optimizing cloud-native applications.

I'm on a mission to transition into a DevOps Engineer role, and I'm actively building an end-to-end portfolio to demonstrate my skills in automation, CI/CD, and cloud infrastructure.

### What I'm Doing Now

* **Solving SaaS Issues:** I'm gaining real-world experience in API troubleshooting (OAuth2, SAML), scripting (Python, Bash), and resolving database and cloud-related issues.
* **Building a Portfolio:** I'm creating live projects to showcase my proficiency in DevOps tools. You can view my progress on my pinned repositories below.
* **Creating Content:** I'm documenting my learnings and most common troubleshooting scenarios on my blog and in my self-published book, which you can soon find here: [Link to your website/blog]
* **Growing a Business:** I am building a portfolio of digital products on Gumroad to share my knowledge with the community and create a passive income stream.
